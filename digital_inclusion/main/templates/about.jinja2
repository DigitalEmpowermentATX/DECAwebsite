                        <p>The Digital Empowerment Community of Austin (DECA) is a network of non-profits, educational instititions,
                            and other stakeholders working together to improve our community's ability to participate in
                            digital society, making a more digitally inclusive Austin.</p>
                        <h3>What is Digital Inclusion?</h3>
                        <p>Digital inclusion is the ability of individuals and groups to equally access and use information
                            and communication technologies afordably, efficiently, and reliably along with digital training,
                            resources, and skills needed to fully participate in a digital society.</p>
                        <h3>How We Started</h3>
                        <p>DECA was officially convened on Thursday, October 29th, 2015 when more than 80 community stakeholders
                            convened in the Asian American Resource Center to collaborate and brainstorm on challenges and
                            opportunities in connecting our community. This meeting commenced Phase I of the co-creation
                            strategy that developed a list of
                            <a href="http://austintexas.gov/page/digital-inclusion-strategic-plan">short, medium, and long-term initiatives</a> that could have the highest impact on digital inclusion.</p>
                        <p>Four working groups were convened to work towards problem identification and solution generation
                            and implementation. The four working groups are linked at the bottom of the page.</p>
                        <h3>Where We Are Today</h3>
                        <p>The Train the Trainer working group has since evolved into what is now the Capacity working group.
                            Throughout its evolution, the working group fostered a sense of community ownership and leadership
                            with the effort of bringing awareness to digital inequities in Austin and opportunities that
                            support digital inclusion.</p>
