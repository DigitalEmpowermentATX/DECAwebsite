This meeting commenced Phase I of the co-creation strategy that developed a list of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://austintexas.gov/page/digital-inclusion-strategic-plan\">short, medium, and long-term initiatives</a>&nbsp;that could have the highest impact on digital inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four working groups were convened to work towards problem identification and solution generation and implementation. The four working groups are linked at the bottom of the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where We Are Today</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Train the Trainer working group has since evolved into what is now the Capacity working group. Throughout its evolution, the working group fostered a sense of community ownership and leadership with the effort of bringing awareness to digital inequities in Austin and opportunities that support digital inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Latest Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Join our Google Group -&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Digital-Equity-ATX@googlegroups.com\">Digital-Equity-ATX@googlegroups.com</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Subscribe to our Digital Inclusion Newsletter&ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.eepurl.com/UUKMv\">www.eepurl.com/UUKMv</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Attend our monthly DECA Meetings&ndash;&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jesse.rodriguez@austintexas.gov?subject=DECA%20Meeting%20Question&amp;body=Please%20include%20your%20name%20and%20contact%20information.\">Contact Jesse Rodriguez</a>&nbsp;for info on the next meeting</li>\r\n\t<li>Attend community events that promote digital inclusion\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Greater Austin STEM Networking Forum</strong>&nbsp;(April 11, 5:30-6pm, @ ACC Highland)</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Maker Faire Austin</strong>&nbsp;(May 5-6, 10am-6pm, @ Thinkery)</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>ATX Hack4Change</strong>&nbsp;(June 1-3, @St. Edward&#39;s University)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Resources and Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrZ9dEcKmoWYafBc\">Capacity Working Group</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrLxIh7MVsW04V2a\">Curriculum Standards Working Group</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrRsvhUL58km676i\">Standard Client Survey Working Group</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrfZDYVQcMglxm2c\">TechHire Working Group</a></p>"}}, {"model": "main.uicomponent", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Index Highlights", "text": "<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
